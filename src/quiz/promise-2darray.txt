The code sets up a function called `sum2DArray()` to asynchronously compute the sum of elements within a 2D array. When invoked with a valid 2D array, the function initiates the sum calculation, logs messages signaling the start of the process, then after a brief delay, it fulfills the promise with the calculated sum before returning from the function. Conversely, if the input is not an array, the function rejects the promise, issuing an error message specifying the expected input type.

Following this, two promises are instantiated with different inputs: one with a valid 2D array (array2D) and the other with a string ('array2D'). These promises are managed using `.then()` and `.catch()` methods to capture either the resolved value or the reason for rejection, respectively. The asynchronous nature of execution allows the script to proceed while awaiting the resolution or rejection of promises. Consequently, logging messages indicating promise creation, resolution, rejection, and handling are interleaved based on the asynchronous execution order and any synchronous code present in the script.
