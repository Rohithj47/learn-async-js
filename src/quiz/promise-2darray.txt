Explanation of the code execution sequence can be explained by observing the order of logged messages in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt:

1. The message "Sum called ..." denotes the initiation of the execution of the sum2DArray() function, which is recorded in the main thread.
2. Upon encountering "returning from sum," it indicates that the function execution has reached the conclusion of the sum2DArray() function block.
3. The appearance of "rejecting ..." signifies an occurrence when the input parameter passed to sum2DArray() is not an array. This precedes the execution of sumPromise1, as it is expedient to reject an invalid input promptly, as seen in the case of sumPromise2.
4. Following the rejection handling block, the message "returning from sum" resurfaces once more.
5. Another instance of "Sum called ..." is logged when sum2DArray() is invoked with 'array2D'.
6. The logging of "resolving ..." ensues when the promise is successfully resolved with a valid input array.
7. The message "Sum Promise 1: 45" denotes the affirmative resolution of the promise, yielding the correct sum value.
8. Finally, "Sum Promise 2 Error: BAD INPUT: Expected array as input" is logged consequent to the rejection of the promise due to an invalid input. In this scenario, a string was provided instead of an array.
